InBetween

This program act as a in between program when on program (client) try to control
another program (server). Typical: a chess GUI that try to control the engine.
Sometimes the command sets of both programs are in conflict. It is here you can
use this little utility to adjust the command after it is delivered from the client
and before it receives on the server.

Syntax: InBetween [/t filename /p priority /c /d n /l logfile] <command line>
Where:
  /t textfile with the translation. Default=InBetween.ini
  /p Priority flag, low, normal or high. Default is the same as this process.
  /c Stop ctrl signals (ctrl c). Default is passing through.
     Not used by Winboard, eg. need a console.
  /d Debug where n could be 1=client side, 2=server side, 3=both
  /l Logfile

Ex.
InBetween engine.exe
This will start the program engine.exe and use the file InBetween.ini as a
translator file.

You could also specifies what translator file you will use with the parameter /t

Ex.
InBetween /t engine.txt engine.exe

This will look in the file engine.txt for word to translatet.

Another option is a possibility to set the priority of the server program
You do this with the /p parameters.
Valid option is /p low, /p normal /p high
Normaly this is adjusted by the GUI, but if your engine is multi-threaded this
would only be done on the main thread. If you set it here it will start the engine
in this priority class instead an thereby all thread get this priority.

Example of an InBetween.ini file.
[InBetween]
; You can set program option here if its not possible in the server program
;Priority := low, normal or high
;CommandLine := c:\Program files\Engines\Crafty\wcrafty.exe
;Debug := 0,1,2,3
;Ctrl := False or True
;Log := logfile.log

[Client2Server]
; Set the translation of client command to server here.

[Server2Client]
; Set the translation of server response to the client here.


Debug mode
Colors
Blue  - is flow to the server
Red   - flow to the client
Green - Control signal etc.

When debug := 1
Viewpoint is on the client interface.

When debug := 2
Viewpoint is on the server interface.

When debug := 3
Viewpoint is after the translation (input to client and input to server).
